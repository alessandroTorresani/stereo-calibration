## OpenCV C++ Stereo Camera Calibration - Support for openCV 4 and Docker

This is fork of the work of [sourishg/stereo-calibration](https://github.com/sourishg/stereo-calibration) adding support for OpenCV 4 and including two Dockerfiles to build it on amd64 and arm architectures. I've changed also the way images are read from the disk, using now the modern C++17 filesystem library.
